This is a difficult question for me to answer since I did not join Flatiron as someone who doesn't have a software development background, but as someone who already has been in the field for many years. However, despite those years of experience and a CS degree, I still feel like there is just still so much to learn and that I'll never keep up. Realistically though, given how much the landscape has changed in the last decade, unless I finally found myself a Matrix learning machine, it would be near impossible to learn all the different fields that programming has expanded to (AI, machine learning, data science, mobile apps, web development, embedded software, application software ...) the list is long!

Prior to the creation of the internet, I had envisioned myself going into the field of psychology or something perhaps more crafty as I was always a lover of the arts. But one day, I'm not sure how I decided to do it, but my love of figure skating motivated me to want to figure out how to create a webpage and showcase my love of figure skating. I cobbled together a simple page using just HTML at the time, signed up with Geocities and Tripod sometime in 1996 and started creating web sites from that point on. I started dabbling with HTML, CSS, creating images using Photoshop, even using very basic javascript to "change" an image when doing a mouseover. This is when I started thinking I might actually be interested in combining my two interests of computing and arts by becoming a computer animator.

Well, that didn't pan out since I entered my university trying to major in Computer Science when I found out I should have majored in the arts instead if I had wanted to become a computer animator. Computer Science did not come easy for me. I struggled, sweated, spent all my spare time in labs and in the library trying to figure out how to get my programs to work, when others around me made it seem like it came without so much as a blink of an eye. At the same time, I continued to work on some of my webpages in what little spare time I had.

So that was how I fell into the world of software development. I never pursued learning web development except for whatever time I had to learn on my own. Having never had that option at school, I never looked for jobs after I graduated in this field, though, thinking back know, I probably could have. For whatever reason though, I didn't, and ended up in the world of embedded programming, writing C.

I found that I enjoyed writing and debugging code, as long as the work environment allowed me to learn and expand my programming skills allowing myself to grow gradually and learn from my own mistakes. There is something very satisfying when you get a function or a module to work. This is why I continue to work in software development and intend to expand my horizons and my skills while returning to my first love of web development by signing up with Flatiron. I'm hoping I'll finally get to working on those projects I've wanted to create for myself with these more updated tools, languages and new found knowledge in my arsenal!
